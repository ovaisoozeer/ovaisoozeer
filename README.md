## Hi!

My name's Ovais, and I'm a software developer with a passion for defining and delivering long-lived solutions.

Whilst technically proficient, I focus heavily on the human side of the practice, supporting teams to discover and achieve their outcomes.

I believe that fast feedback, and frequent dialogue with stakeholders using shared terminology around a shared vision, can overcome many of the hurdles commonly faced by software projects.

This GitHub profile thing is new, but I do have a portfolio site at [https://ovaisoozeer.github.io/](https://ovaisoozeer.github.io/)
